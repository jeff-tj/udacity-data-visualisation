# Animation
js setTimeout() to run after a specific length of time
js setInterval() to run at specified intervals:
	*first argument is the function to run
	*second argument is interval in ms

d3 has built in transition:
	.transition()
	.duration(how_long)
This is one advantage of using d3 to sytle
If use css/html the transitions don't apply
